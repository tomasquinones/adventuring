My name is Tomas Quinones and this blog focuses on my bicycling adventures in the great outdoors of the Pacific Northwest and beyond. Currently basecamped in Portland, Oregon, I'll be writing about gravel rides, long weekends, touring, bikepacking, the gear I like and (maybe) don't like along the way.

This blog is also a place for me to learn more about front-end web development and creating content so the layout and pages may change from time to time without warning. 

### More Information
I currently work at [https://ridewithgps.com](https://ridewithgps.com) doing all sorts of stuff.

Photography is a ton of fun! Currently shooting with a Sony a6000 with several e-mount lenses.
