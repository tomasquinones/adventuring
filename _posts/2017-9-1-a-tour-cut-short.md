This is taking a lot longer than anticipated. 

impending doom

bringing too much stuff

sleeping in the parking lot

full of stars

**Day 2**
nice descent

bumpy road

getting warm

long hot highway

melting cyclists 

red horizon

fields station

missing the time
slow going
sleeping in the backyard 
waking to a red sunrise
calling it
waiting for my ride
heading north
so smokey
miles and miles of gravel
the alvord desert
north of burns
falling ash
eagle creek fire
smoky hood
stopping home
cape disappointment disappointment
ft stevens
