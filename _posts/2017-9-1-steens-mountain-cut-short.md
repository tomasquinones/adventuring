The Plan:

**Day 1: Climbing**

Starting at dawn, the air chilled as ice. I packed up and kissed my sweetie goodbye. I knew I had hours of climbing ahead of me but I had not anticipated it taking so long. 

Shortly after starting and only a few miles into the route I realized that I may be in for a full day of pedaling to my destination. I covered only a few measily miles in 1 hour.

The day wore on, the air grew warm and dry which rapidly depleated my water bottles. Not even halfway up the route I had to stop for water at a camp ground. 

By the time I made it to mile 20, the air was thick with dust kicked up by passing vehicles. 

One passerby was kind enough to hand me a beer to drink in celebration at the summit.

**Day 2**
Waking just before dawn, I quickly packed up to start my day.

The descent was quick, loose, and bumpy. So many times I had to come to a complete stop to give my braking hands a rest and let the blood flow back into my white knuckles. 

Met a few cyclists on the descent. They were doing the same route as I but in the opposite direction. 

Refilled water at a campground. 




missing the time
slow going
sleeping in the backyard 
waking to a red sunrise
calling it
waiting for my ride
heading north
so smokey
miles and miles of gravel
the alvord desert
north of burns
falling ash
eagle creek fire
smoky hood
stopping home
cape disappointment disappointment
ft stevens
